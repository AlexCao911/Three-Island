/**
 * IMPORTANT: Loading glTF models into a Three.js scene is a lot of work.
 * Before we can configure or animate our model's meshes, we need to iterate through
 * each part of our model's meshes and save them separately.
 *
 * But luckily there is an app that turns gltf or glb files into jsx components
 * For this model, visit https://gltf.pmnd.rs/
 * And get the code. And then add the rest of the things.
 * YOU DON'T HAVE TO WRITE EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH
